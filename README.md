# download-austen-book

As a big Jane Austen fan, I knew I wanted to read *The Making of Jane Austen* when I saw the book was available for [free online](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/51997) from the publisher. However, I didn't want to download the PDFs for each chapter separately!

Thankfully, with help from the ever useful book [*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), I was able to write a couple scripts to download and merge the PDFs (without the cover pages) into a single file to put on my Kindle:

#### [*The Making of Jane Austen* (pdf)](TheMakingOfJaneAusten.pdf)

Happy reading!
